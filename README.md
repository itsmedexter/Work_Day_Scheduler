# Work Day Scheduler

Here is a Work Day Scheduler created in Jquery. Jquery is used to create new items in a blank html field with editable text input, saving text input to localStorage, and current date and time features. 

# Questions that came about 

 1. How do you change a dynamic table data rows with a time frame, change rows with different colors? Create seven new variables and functions just changing the time?
 
2. var data = [{ date: new Date(), todo: '', editing: false };
This var data is what the tutor helped me with, but I don't understand it. I think from left to right is the time, input field, edit/save button.
